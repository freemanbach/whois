# whois data
## testing whois servers
A script to check whether each of the whois servers listed in the data.csv file is ALIVE.
I've started with slightly over 600 whois servers in the initial whois server file, many of those had been removed due to either 300 or 500 error code.
Also, some of the servers removed from this final list only allowed https and not http. The remaining servers on this list do allowed http and are active for that TLD.

Tinkering with whois via some scripting language.
